                    What determines the ultimate success or failure of your clinic is easily defined: the number of acquired and retained patients.

                    Successful chiropractic clinics are created by and thrive on a combination of proven systems working consistently together. Few, if any, practice owners when asked, can contribute their success to just one thing. However, all successful chiropractic clinics share this one vital trait: They are successful because of the relationships they have established with their patients. Patients don’t buy your services; rather, they invest in a relationship.

                    <b>Chiropractic Newsletter</b> is guaranteed to help your clinic build trust and strong relationships with your patients, while educating them on your treatment philosophy and their treatment options.

                    The days of putting up a shingle and waiting for patients to flood through your doors are over. Whether you are a solo practitioner, or the owner of a large clinic; you need to create a perception of who you are to your community, in order to distinguish your clinic from your chiropractic competitors, as well as from physical therapists, local doctors, and anyone else that could potentially steer your patients elsewhere.

                    Twice each month, with Chiropractic Newsletter’s automated system, a content-rich, completely done-for-you newsletter, arrives via email, video, or fax to your patient list; delivering clear, consistent and compelling messages, professionally written, that influence and attracts more patients. You also have the option of a printable version for in-office displays and hand-outs to patients during their visits.

                    Chiropractic Newsletter was created by a private practice owner who has an apprehension of the day-to-day pressures of running the business side of a practice; finding effective ways to market it to new and existing patients; establishing a rapport with your patients and keeping it – all while working long hours in the clinic itself. Each day, overwhelming feelings stronger as these tasks seem to grow while the time you have to do them seems to be continuingly shrinking.

                <p class="content">
                    Can you really afford to spend valuable time away from patient treatments to write a series of newsletters twice every month that markets your clinic and maintains regular communication with your patients? Do you add more hours to an already long day racking your brain to write fresh articles, edit and properly format them? At the end of these tasks, are you too drained to spend any real quality time with your family and friends?
