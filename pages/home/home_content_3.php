                    <li>Patients will be eager to give you their email address – Gather email addresses after patients come to your website by giving them access to FREE “patient stimulator” downloads of EBooks which Chiropractic Newsletter supplies.</li>
                    <li>After new and existing patients leave their name and email information in the provided form – they gain access to these ready-to-use “lead generators” that are fully customizable on such patient-relevant subjects as: Chiropractic and Headaches; Chiropractic Treatment of Disc Herniation; and Chiropractic: Back Pain and Pregnancy.</li>
                    <li>After their information is entered, it is automatically entered into your Chiropractic Newsletter account, and patients will start receiving customized newsletters from your clinic twice every month. You may even send an email sequence that specifically tars different patient segments of your list:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A welcome sequence for new patients</li>
                            <li>A sequence for patients who miss appointments</li>
                            <li>A sequence for discharged patients</li>
                            <li>A “special occasion’ sequence (patient birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays)…and much more.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Chiropractic Newsletter also has available a proprietary script to collect patient email addresses that can be used on the phone, in person, or in a letter. Tested and proven effective, this script will have at least 90% of those patients contacted happy to give their email information to you.</li>
                    <li>Implementation of your customized newsletter takes 20 minutes or less – automating your practice’s referral generation and marketing.</li>

                <p class="content text-center fw-bold">
                    Even in the absence of a website, email patient lists, or technical knowledge, Chiropractic Newsletter can serve as your clinic’s all-in-one communication system, effectively creating rapport and trust with new patients, fostering internal referrals, and build loyalty with existing patients.
